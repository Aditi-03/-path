# Pathfinding-Demo
This project  is for finding shortest path between 2 points using diferent algothihm and their visualizations.


# Implementation Timeline:

## week 1:
* Decide on rendering library
* Setup page for drawing
* Get user input for adding walls

## week 2:
* Setup for abstraction of algorithm implementations
* API for algorithms to render steps with
* Line drawing
* Start control panel (placeholder content)
* Start first algorithm 

## week 3:
* Finish first algorithm
* Finish control panel

## week 4: 
* More algorithms!
* Performance reports!
* Host on gh-pages
